### Conway's game of life

Dont you love to see it. Another Conway's game of life implementation!

Well that is true, this isnt special by any means, prolly has a lot of bad code in it. But it is what it is

NOTE: This will crash your machine eventually because for some reason turtle like to have a stupid amount of ram usage and i cant do anything to clear the turtle to stop it from using too much ram
